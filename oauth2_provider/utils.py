    Recommended user code that retains enough entropy but doesn't
    ruin the user experience of typing the code in.

    This follows the guidance in:
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628#section-5.1
    with an explanation of the entropy this implementation provides.

    entropy (in bits) = length of user code * log2(size of the character set)

    This implementation uses a 32-character (Base32) alphabet, so for the
    default length of 8 characters:

        e = 8 * log2(32) = 8 * 5 = 40 bits

    i.e. there are 32^8 == 2^40 possible codes. (The generated code is a plain
    string with no separator; any grouping/hyphenation is a presentation concern
    for the UI, not part of the value.)

    An attacker would need to try up to 2^40 combinations to exhaust the space.
    Note that this library does not itself rate-limit or expire the verification
    step, so deployments should keep the code's validity window short and
    rate-limit the verification endpoint to make brute-forcing impractical.

    The code is drawn from ``secrets`` (a CSPRNG) rather than ``random`` so
    that the ``user_code`` is unguessable, as required for device-flow
    credentials by RFC 8628 sections 5.1 and 5.2.
